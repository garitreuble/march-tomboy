#March#
*By Madison Julius Cawein*

**This is the *tomboy* month of all the year,**

March, who comes shouting o'er the winter hills,

Waking the world with laughter, as she wills,

Or wild halloos, a windflower in her ear.

She stops a moment by the half-thawed mere

And whistles to the wind, and straightway shrills

The hyla's song, and hoods of daffodils

Crowd golden round her, leaning their heads to hear.

Then through the woods, that drip with all their eaves,

Her mad hair blown about her, loud she goes

Singing and calling to the naked trees;

And straight the oilets of the little leaves

Open their eyes in wonder, rows on rows,

And the first     bluebird bugles to the breeze.
